# Self-Learning Project In React

This is a self-learning app created by me to get more experience and knowledge for the very first time and this is based on creating some meetups and there as technical skills and methodologies I have used,
  I created components with styles and passed necessary properties of them as props 
  I created a form to add the meetups and for that, I used the useState and useEffect hooks
  For the Routes, I used React Router Dom 
  as a Backend, I use Firebase backend and I use fetch API to fetch the data
